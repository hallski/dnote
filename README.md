# dnote

This is cli to work with my notes as Markdown files. It's primarely built to
serve my own needs with the idea that anyone who have different needs can fork
and extend their own version.

## Features

- Files are numbered from 001.md (once you reach 1000 notes, update IDLength and run `dnote migrate` to update the notes)

## Setup
Copy ./dnote.yaml.example to ~/.config/dnote.yaml and edit it to work for your
setup.
