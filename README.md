# Thinkadus

This is cli to work with my notes as Markdown files.

Requirements:
* Work in conjunction to Vim
* Offline mode supported
* Text based and easily editable as such
* Be able to serve/view the files as HTML with working links

Nice to haves:
* Be able to view the files in Github

It's also being used to learn a bit of Go.

## Keg
Found https://github.com/rwxrob/keg/ that can work as a nice reference.

* Does the structure of using `docs/{id}/README.md` make sense? 
  * It allows attachments like screenshots to fit in the directory with the note
    * This also allow me to create notes without having to come up with a title
      directly.
  * Using incrementing integers as `id` makes sense. They are easy to remember.
